I created a user-friendly web app called Accute Accounting to help over 10 business owners in Delhi's main wholesale market manage their orders and goods effortlessly. The app has a simple interface for easy tracking, processing, and analysis. I also took care of keeping the servers in top shape, making sure they're fast and secure.
